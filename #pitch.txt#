I put down a few bucks for Ethereum and Bitcoin in 2017, thinking this
might be a nice technology to play with.

I tried to buy some Ethereum names, to simplify addressing, but my
MetaMask Chrome extension sent my money into the ether but didn't
deliver me the names I thought I was getting.  What happens when you
try to carry out a transaction and there is no support, noone says
they got the money, you don't get your product, you don't have a
chance to say you accept the deliverable, there's all kinds of
potential fraud and mistakes.

Ecommerce using these crypto seems to need a structured interface
where buyer and seller can interact, money change hands, but subject
to a legally enforceable contract with terms that are understandable
to a court of enforcement and to the participants themselves, and
following a standard procedure the outcomes are predictable.

I wrote a protocol for this in Promela, verified it has no deadlocks
or livelocks or hung states.  Next step is implementation in web apps
and web services and some crypto coin.  Incidentally it seems wise to
have a trusted third party as escrow holder and process enforcer and
judge; this is also a way to monetize such a system, by charging fees
and also by holding escrow funds.

I can't go a lot further without some feedback and support. There are
multiple languages to learn, programs to write, accounts to set up,
and sales to close for this to become a business, and getting from
here to there needs more than me in my living room.

So: What do you think?

Alex:
Search for escrow offering solutions in the crypto space,
escrow is a common concept so probably already implemented and people using it.
So search.

The question: who holds the currency?  A monetary liicense from the
state because you essentially become a bank, it's an expensive
proposition.  Coinbase and bitrex, only,
because binance and kraken didn't get th emonetaru licensee,
because each staate has its rules and regulations becausee crypto is an asset.

Because you're offering an escrow service they'll say you are a bank.
Then it's state by state in the US, can't use it in the US.
Because you are holding the assets.

Hardware wallets, they are holding it, it's not in Alex's possession.
If you structure the Tx one key removed, so I don't have full access to the funds
until a key is given by a participant, make it a private key witho a part missing
and only when the secret code passes by then can't assemble it yourself.

Learn about falling under
money transmit license.
Search for cryptocurrency transmit license in different states. It has been published.

Between
Volatility is an issue, so look for stable-coins pegged to a dollar.
Every transfer is a transaction fee.  If you calculate the fees, could be >3%.
Still not prevalent.

Could be ramification to scanning QR codes into an App to do that kind of stuff.

Secure tx is important. Definitely a needed thing.  There may be
services people doing it already.

Alex says aim at bitcoin because there are bitcoin maximalists, consider their pitch.
Proper addressee is clear in BTC, not so much in Ether.
Perhaps the expectation is for micro accouunts in ETH but
several bitcoin groups discuss in Seattle meeting here.
Two of Alex's folks are contributing to Bitcoin core, building up the protocol and
improvements.  For the business sense,

go to github, look for escrow for bitcoin.  I know there are, I came
across a few of them I'm sure.  Maybe even coinbase offers it as an
option.

License hold, release, transmit funds.

Could put me in touch with john or brandon to talk about progamming and bitcoin core.

bitcore community go to the bitcoin core, they think they are superior to anything else.
